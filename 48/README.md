For Ludum Dare 48, my goal was to learn the Godot Engine. Over the course of the 72-hour jam, I achieved basic proficiency with the engine and was able to successfully produce a game with my collaborator. The game we produced was a simple, top-down arcade shooter.

Theme: Deeper & Deeper

"Falling deeper and deeper into a depression...in the earth, the player must combat their bat feelings with love."
